# Time Series Forecasting (using Prophet as a robust, easy-to-demonstrate model)
prophet # Requires pystan and gcc/C++ tools to install complexly. 
        # Alternatively, use a simpler XGBoost/sklearn model if prophet install is difficult.
        # For simplicity, we will assume Prophet installation succeeds or you choose a simple Linear Regression/XGBoost model. 
        
# For XGBoost (if Prophet is too complex to install):
